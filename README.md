# SoA & Delay with Temporal Illusion

This study aims to look at the effect of delay that is created by a temporal illusion on the explicit sense of agency.

Studies found that the more delay occurs between an action and its outcome, the less agency is felt.
In the present sstudy, whether this reducing effect of the delay on the sense of agency can be created via percieved time instead of physical time is investigatd. The perceived time is manipulated by a video of a walking stickman with different walking speed the speed (50fps, 63fps, 100fps) are used to generate a temporal illusion.\
Faster walking speed is expected to fasten the interal clock leading to percieve the duration longer.

Participants are asked to make a keypress during the video.
Key press produces an auditory outcome with a delay.
The delay is expected to be percieved as different through the different levels of the video speed. As a result, soa is expected to be different depending on the walking speed.

3 different versions of the experiment:

- with a temporal reproduction task to control the effect of the walking speed
- with a temporal bisection task to control the effect of the walking speed
- without any temporal task, only SoA
