# SoA & Delay with Temporal Illusion

This study aims to look at the effect of delay that is created by a temporal illusion on the explicit sense of agency.

Videos of a walking stickman with 3 different walking speed (50fps, 63fps, 100fps)
Faster walking speed is expected to fasten the interal clock leading to percieve the duration longer.

Participants are asked to make a keypress during the video.
Key press produces an auditory outcome with a delay.
The delay is expected to be percieved as different through the different levels of the video speed. As a result, soa is expected to be different depending on the walking speed.

3 different versions of the experiment:

- with a temporal reproduction task to control the effect of the walking speed
- with a temporal bisection task to control the effect of the walking speed
- without any temporal task, only SoA
